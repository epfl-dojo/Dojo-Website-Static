## How to sign the charter
Attendees of the EPFL dojo can commit themself by signing the EPFL Dojo charter.
To do so, please open a PR on the file CHARTER.md:
* Add your github username (alphabetical order) + the date (ISO8601 format);
* Add that you have read and that you agree to commit to the charter;
* Create your Pull Request on the main repository.

## Development
First you have to understand what is Jekyll and how it works. A simple `git clone ...`
wouldn't be enough to run the site locally. You have to setup [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) first.

* install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) (e.g. `sudo apt install jekyll`, `bundle install`)
* checkout the repository
* run (`jekyll serve`)
* go to the listed URL (e.g. http://localhost:4000)
